# Getting Started Todo App

This project provides a sample todo list application. It demonstrates all of
the current Docker best practices, ranging from the Compose file, to the
Dockerfile, to CI (using GitHub Actions), and running tests. It's intended to 
be a well-documented to ensure anyone can come in and easily learn.




This sample application is a simple React frontend that receives data from a
Node.js backend. 

When the application is packaged and shipped, the frontend is compiled into
static HTML, CSS, and JS and then bundled with the backend where it is then
served as static assets. So no... there is no server-side rendering going on
with this sample app.

During development, since the backend and frontend need different dev tools, 
they are split into two separate services. This allows [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) 
to manage the React app while [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) works with the 
backend. With containers, it's easy to separate the development needs!

## Development

To spin up the project, simply install Docker Desktop and then run the following 
commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/docker/getting-started-todo-app
cd getting-started-todo-app
docker compose up -d
```



```
docker compose down
```
